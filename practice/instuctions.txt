ok so this will be your first practice with just simple coding principles

you guys will be using python for the code we will be writing on the rasp pi, so i want u guys to have some experience
with how logic works with python

i know these are really simple problems, and the answers can be pretty easily found online, but i want you 
guys to give this the best shot you can - feel free to google stuff you don't knwo how to do, but 
i want this to challenge you to some extent 
looking stuff up is an ESSENTIAL part of learning and growing a skill, but give it an honest effort
so like dotn ask other people to write it for you, and don't look at each others' code
THERE ARE MULTIPLE WAYS TO DO THIS THERE IS NOT A SINGLE CORRECT ANS

First problem:
	Fizz buzz
		for all whole numbers from 1 to 100
		if the number is a multiple of 3, print fizz
		if the number is a mult of 5, print buzz
		if both (ex. 15), print fizzbuzz
		otherwise, print the number
		(tbh i kinda gave you the solution to this one)

Second problem
	Primes
		find and print all the prime numbers between 1 and n,
		n being any positive integer, given through input 
		(a prime number is defined as an integer with its only factors being 1 and itself)

		*this is a more involved problem, and might take you some time, if you need help, just ask

OK SO NONE OF YOU PAID ATTENTION TO THE GIT SEMINAR SO I GUESS THIS IS HOW IT GOES I GUESS
Git Instructions:

1. follow me (mehulghosal) on github pls and thank and star the repo
2. in terminal: git clone "https://github/mehulghosal/leadzeppelin"
3. cd leadzeppelin/practice (go into the practice directory)
4. open YOUR FILE in your preferred text editor (i suggest sublime text)
5. write code
6. when ur ready to test, in terminal, "python3 filename.py"(mac/linux) or "python filename.py"

7. when u think ur ready to publish, in terminal USE THESE COMMANDS IN ORDER
	git add .
	git commit -m"changed filename.py"
	git push

*git push might as you to log into github - do so 
if u have any more questions - dm me
